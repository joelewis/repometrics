# REPOMETRICS  

REPOMETRICS helps you to check the activity on Github repos, before deciding to adopt the open source project in your product.
It uses your GitHub username/password to make authenticated requests from the browser directly to GitHub. If you don't provide your credentials you will eventually run into rate-limiting problems. Made with ‚ù§ using Vuetify and GitHub API V3 , and some amounts of an Easter weekend.
